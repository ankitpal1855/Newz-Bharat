<h2>
Introduction 
</h2>

<p>Dense fog is a common phenomenon in Delhi during the winter months, especially in the early morning hours. Fog reduces the visibility and affects the air, rail, and road traffic in the city. One of the most affected sectors is the aviation industry, as flights are often delayed or cancelled due to poor weather conditions. In this composition, we will discuss the impact of dense fog on the flight operations at Delhi airport, the causes and consequences of the fog, and the possible solutions to mitigate the problem.</p>

<h2>
  Impact of dense fog on flight operations
</h2>

<p>The dense fog on Monday, December 25, 2023, caused a major disruption in the flight operations at Delhi airport. The visibility dropped to zero, forcing the pilots to use the CAT IIIB operations for takeoffs and landings. Several flights were either delayed or diverted to nearby airports as the foggy conditions persisted. Passengers faced inconvenience and frustration as they waited for hours at the airport or rescheduled their travel plans.</p>

<h2>
Causes of dense fog 
</h2>

<p>The main cause of dense fog in Delhi is the combination of low temperature, high humidity, and calm winds. The temperature in Delhi dropped to 9.4 degrees Celsius on Monday, while the humidity was around 100 per cent. The winds were also very light, which prevented the dispersion of the fog. The fog formation was also aided by the high levels of pollution in the city, as the particulate matter and aerosols acted as condensation nuclei for the water vapour.</p>

<h2>
Consequences of dense fog
</h2>

<p>The dense fog not only disrupts the flight operations, but also has several other negative consequences for the city and its people. Some of the major consequences are:

Economic loss: The delay or cancellation of flights causes a huge economic loss for the airlines, the airport authorities, and the passengers.
Health hazards: The exposure to the fog and the pollution can cause various health problems for the people, such as respiratory infections, asthma, allergies, eye irritation, and reduced immunity.
Social inconvenience: The fog affects the daily life of the people, as they face difficulties in commuting, working, studying, and travelling.</p>

<h2>
Possible solutions
</h2>

<p>
To deal with the problem of dense fog, some of the possible solutions are:
  
Improving the infrastructure: The airport authorities should upgrade the infrastructure and the technology to enable the smooth functioning of the flight operations in low visibility conditions. The airport should have more runways, parking bays, and CAT III systems to handle the increased traffic and the foggy situations. The airlines should also equip their aircrafts and pilots with the necessary instruments and training to operate in the fog.
Reducing the pollution: The government and the public should take measures to reduce the pollution levels in the city, which contribute to the fog formation. The government should enforce strict emission norms, promote public transport, ban stubble burning, and implement the odd-even scheme to curb the vehicular pollution. The public should also adopt eco-friendly practices, such as using renewable energy, planting trees, and avoiding crackers.
Increasing the awareness: The people should be made aware of the causes and consequences of the fog, and the ways to cope with it. The media and the social platforms should disseminate the information and the advisories about the fog and the flight operations. The passengers should also check the status of their flights before leaving for the airport, and follow the instructions of the airport staff and the airlines.</p>

<h2>
Conclusion 
</h2>

<p>Dense fog is a serious problem that affects the flight operations at Delhi airport, as well as the health, economy, and social life of the city. The problem is caused by the low temperature, high humidity, calm winds, and high pollution in the city. The problem can be solved by improving the infrastructure, reducing the pollution, and increasing the awareness among the people. The government, the airport authorities, the airlines, and the public should work together to overcome the challenge of dense fog and ensure the safety and convenience of the passengers.</p>
