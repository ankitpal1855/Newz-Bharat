<p>According to the news report1, Arman Khan, an 18-year-old, is now in judicial custody as the prime suspect in a murder case in Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi. Arman had met a woman on Instagram and had gone on a date with her on December 28, 2023. However, things took a violent turn when he found out that she was married and had a child. He felt betrayed and angry, and decided to take revenge on her.</p>

<p>He allegedly stabbed her 50 times with a knife and then fled the scene, leaving her to die in a pool of blood. The police were alerted by the locals who heard her screams and found her body. They traced Arman through his Instagram profile and arrested him from his home in Noida. He confessed to his crime and said that he wanted to teach her a lesson for lying to him.</p>

<p>This incident raises several questions about the safety and ethics of online dating. How can one trust a stranger on the internet? How can one verify the identity and background of a potential partner? How can one avoid falling prey to fraudsters and predators? How can one protect oneself from physical and emotional harm?
One possible solution is to be more cautious and careful while using online platforms for dating. One should not share personal or financial information with anyone without verifying their credibility. One should not meet anyone in a secluded or unfamiliar place without informing someone else. One should not blindly trust anyone without knowing them well. One should also report any suspicious or abusive behavior to the authorities and the platform.</p>

<p>Another possible solution is to promote more awareness and education about online dating among the youth. One should be aware of the risks and challenges involved in online dating and how to deal with them. One should also be aware of the legal and moral implications of online dating and how to respect the rights and feelings of others. One should also be aware of the help and support available for victims of online violence and harassment.</p>

<p>Online dating can be a wonderful way to find love and happiness, but it can also be a dangerous and tragic way to lose them. One should be smart and responsible while using online dating and not let it become a source of misery and pain. One should also remember that behind every online profile, there is a real human being with emotions and dignity, and treat them accordingly.
